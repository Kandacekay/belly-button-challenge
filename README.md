# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Overview
This repository serves as the foundation for an interactive dashboard designed to explore the intriguing world of the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset meticulously catalogs microbial species inhabiting human navels, providing a comprehensive glimpse into the diversity of these microscopic inhabitants.

## Project Structure
### Repository Creation

1. Repository Establishment:
   - A new repository, named belly-button-challenge, was created to encapsulate this project. This repository is dedicated solely to the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard.

2. Local Environment Setup:
   - The repository was cloned to the local machine, allowing for seamless collaboration and development.
  
### File Configuration
1. File Transfer:
   - Essential project files, including index.html, samples.json, and the static folder, were copied from the StarterCode folder provided in the Module 14 Challenge zip file. These files lay the groundwork for the dashboard's functionality and aesthetics.

### GitHub Management
1. GitHub Interaction:
   - Changes made to the local repository were pushed to the GitHub repository, facilitating version control and collaborative development.
2. Deployment to GitHub Pages:
   - The repository was successfully deployed to GitHub Pages, providing a publicly accessible platform for users to interact with the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard.

## Dashboard Features and Functionality
### Bar Chart Implementation
1. Bar Chart Initialization:
   - The dashboard features a visually appealing bar chart that initializes without errors.
2. Dynamic Chart Update:
   - A dynamic chart update mechanism was implemented, ensuring that the displayed information adapts seamlessly to user interactions and the selection of new samples.
3. Top 10 Sample Values:
   - The bar chart is configured to display the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) as sample values, shedding light on the prevalence of specific microbial species.
4. Labeling and Tooltip Integration:
   - Utilizing otu_ids as labels and incorporating otu_labels for tooltip information enhances the interpretability of the chart, providing users with detailed insights into the microbial composition.

## Bubble Chart Integration
1. Bubble Chart Initialization:
   -An engaging bubble chart, serving as an additional visualization tool, was seamlessly integrated into the dashboard.
2. Dynamic Bubble Chart Update:
   - The bubble chart dynamically updates in response to user interactions and the selection of new samples, maintaining an interactive and informative user experience.
3. Comprehensive Marker Settings:
   - Leveraging otu_ids for marker colors, sample_values for marker size, and incorporating otu_labels as text values, the bubble chart offers a comprehensive representation of microbial characteristics.

## Metadata Display
1. Metadata Initialization:
   -Essential metadata, encompassing demographic information about individuals, is flawlessly initialized on the dashboard.
2. Dynamic Metadata Update:
   - Metadata updates dynamically as users explore different samples, ensuring that relevant demographic details accompany each dataset.

## Gauge Chart Enhancement:
1. An optional and advanced feature was incorporated to adapt the Gauge Chart, effectively plotting the weekly washing frequency of individuals.
   - This enhancement adds an extra layer of insight into hygiene practices.
2. Dynamic Gauge Update:
   - The Gauge Chart dynamically updates with each new sample selection, providing users with real-time information on washing frequency.

## Conclusion
This project successfully combines technical proficiency in data visualization with user-friendly design, offering an immersive exploration of the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The thoughtful integration of diverse charts and the seamless dynamic updates enhance the overall user experience, making scientific exploration both accessible and engaging. The deployment to GitHub Pages ensures widespread accessibility, allowing users to delve into the microbial mysteries residing in our navels.
